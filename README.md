express-validate
================


A very simple Express middleware to… well, validate stuff.

## Available validators

* required
* email
* equals
* lengthBetween
* maxLength
* minLength
* between
* greaterThan
* lowerThan
* nonNegative
* positive
* negative
* match
* …write your your own!

## Options

```
validator = require '../lib/express-validate'
app.use validator options
```

`options` is an object with possible properties:

* `rules` - (*object*) - additional rules (described later)
* `errorParser` - (*function*) - a function taking 3 arguments: `req`, `res` and `errors` (an array of error messages). If validation resulted in no errors, `errors` will be an empty array.
  
  example usage - returning JSON object
  
  ```
  errorParser: (req, res, err) ->
		res.send {
			errors: err
		}
  ```
  
* `exposeMixedParams` - (*bool*) - if `true`, `req.p` will become an object containing params available in `req.params`, `req.query` and `req.body`.


## Usage examples

### Basic validation

Server code:

```
express = require 'express'
validator = require '../lib/express-validate'

app = express()
app.use express.json()

app.use validator()

app.get '/', (req, res) ->
	req.validate {
		name: 'required'             # single validation rule
		mail: ['required', 'email']  # or an array of rules
	}
	
	res.send "it's ok"

app.listen 3000, () ->
	console.log "Listening on 3000…"
```

Requests:

```
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000"
name is requried.
~ ➢ curl localhost:3000/?name=maciej
mail is requried.
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000/?name=maciek&mail=me@mpawlowski.pl"
it's ok

```

### Customizing error messages

Validation code:

```
   req.validate {
		name: {rule: 'required', message: '%s is required!' }
		age: ['required', {
			rule: 'greaterThan'
			than: 18
			message: 'Hey, you must be over %than to see the content. Please, provide the correct %s' 
		}]
	}
```

Requests:

```
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000/?name=maciej"
age is requried.
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000/?name=maciej&age=17"
Hey, you must be over 18 to see the content. Please, provide the correct age
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000/?name=maciej&age=24"
it's ok
```

### Adding custom rules

Server code:

```
express = require 'express'
validator = require '../lib/express-validate'

app = express()
app.use express.json()

app.use validator
	rules: [
		{
			name: 'FOO'
			rule:
				message: '%s must equal FOO'
				test: (str) ->
					return false unless str # it's not required
					return true unless str == 'FOO'
		}
		{
			name: 'lengthBetween'
			rule:
				message: '%s must be between %low and %high characters long'
				low: 3
				high: 5
				test: (str, rule) ->
					return false unless str 
					return true unless typeof str == 'string'
					
					low = rule.low or @low
					high = rule.high or @high
					len = str.length
					
					return true unless low <= len <= high
		}
	]

app.get '/', (req, res) ->
	req.validate {
		foo: 'FOO'
		str: { rule: 'lengthBetween', low: 4, high: 7 }
	}
	
	res.send "it's ok"

app.listen 3000, () ->
	console.log "Listening on 3000…"
```

Requests:

```
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000/?foo=1"
foo must equal FOO
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000/?foo=FOO"
it's ok
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000/?str=mp"
str must be between 4 and 7 characters long
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000/?str=1234"
it's ok
~ ➢ curl "localhost:3000/?str=12345678"
str must be between 4 and 7 characters long
```
